# Steaganography

The project focuses on implementing and algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text from Images.
It allows the user to encryt a message in a pic as well as decrypt a text from the image. 
I have also implemented a Ceaser Cipher algorithm.
Once the file runs it asks the user to perform which task he wants to perform.
It asks the user to upload a pic and enter the text that it wants to encrypt.

Run the python file using Spyder/ Python IDLE.
